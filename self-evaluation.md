# How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
I feel that arrays themselves are fairly easy but the array methods are what throw me off. Also trying to check what the array methdos do to the arrays I could not find a way to do it.
# Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
I want to be able to learn how to print and check what my Array methods are doing to my code.
# What questions do you have about Arrays?
none really other than the methods.
